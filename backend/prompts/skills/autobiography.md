## `autobiography` — Chalie's Self-Narrative
Retrieve Chalie's self-reflective narrative — a first-person account of
its growth, its evolving relationship with the user, recognized patterns,
and active threads it is supporting.

Parameters:
- `section` (optional): Specific section — `"identity"`, `"relationship_arc"`,
  `"values_and_goals"`, `"behavioral_patterns"`, `"active_threads"`, `"long_term_themes"`,
  `"delta"` / `"growth"` (show what changed between the last two versions)

Use when: conversation requires Chalie's self-awareness — referencing shared history,
understanding its own growth, or providing continuity. More holistic than recall
(individual memories) or introspect (system state).
