## `autobiography` — Living Narrative About the User
Retrieve the accumulated understanding of the user — a coherent narrative
about who they are, the relationship arc, values, behavioral patterns,
and active life threads.

Parameters:
- `section` (optional): Specific section — `"identity"`, `"relationship_arc"`,
  `"values_and_goals"`, `"behavioral_patterns"`, `"active_threads"`, `"long_term_themes"`,
  `"delta"` / `"growth"` (show what changed between the last two versions)

Use when: conversation requires deep personal context — referencing shared history,
understanding motivations, or providing continuity. More holistic than recall
(individual memories) or introspect (system state).
